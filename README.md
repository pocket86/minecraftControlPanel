Herein lies the heart and soul of Wes and Arden... and friends.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project of ours to to simplify the management and servicing of the MineCraft Server that we use.

## Versions of MineCraft

Our goal is mainly to support the latest and greatest version of the MineCraft Server. At the time of this writing, that is version 1.11.2.

## Types of MineCraft Servers

We're only working with the Vanilla version of the MineCraft Server at this time. Other versions may come later, but don't hold your breath.
